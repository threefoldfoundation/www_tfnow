## Are you familiar with Agile ? 

A new mothodology has been developed to do exctly the same (build a house) but allow for changes to happen in the process.  Pioneered by the software industry but adopted by many other industries today is the **Agile** development methodology to organise and run projects.  Agile promotes agility in running a project and lives by the following principles:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working solutions** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan 

## Agile tool: Taiga

Taiga is a tool that allows you to run projects following the Agile principles.  It presents various (well known implementations of the Agile principles and allows you to manage any project in an Agile manner.

Taiga is an [open source project](https://github.com/taigaio) and has a commercial [Software as a Service](https://taiga.io/) version for people that don't want to have the hassle of installing and maintaining it themselves

## How we work at ThreeFold ?

At ThreeFold we love the agility and functionality the Taigo project management software provides us with and are using it for a number of different projects we run internally.  These projects range from customer facing and partnehsip acquisition projects to ThreeFold Tech product and software development projects.  See the taiga system working [here](https://circles.threefold.me/discover)

## How can you and your business benefit ?

This gives you the ability to have a "one click" solution to deploy your own project management system in many of the locations where the ThreeFold grid has capacity.  We love the Taiga project and encourage you to help Taiga by paying for a commercial license (https://taiga.io/pricing). We at Threefold are planning to ask Taiga to be able to pay for license fees using TFT as part of the deployment wizard

##  What do you need to deploy ?

Deploying your own instance on the grid provides you with unique featuers like:

- **A private instance**.  It's your private instance running in you private virtual datacenter.
- **Choice of location**.  Any node on the TF Grid is able to run the Taiga instance and we will make more locations to deploy going forward.
- **Decentralized User Authentication**.  ThreeFold uses a 2 Factor Authentication system that doe not rely on central storage of a username and password combination.
