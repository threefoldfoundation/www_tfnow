## Why cryptpad ?

Many alternatives are available to the the dominant office tools from Microsoft and Google, but ThreeFold endorses and supports CryptPad.fr open-source CryptPad project.

[CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/what-is-cryptpad.html) is a private-by-design alternative to popular office tools and cloud services. All the content stored on CryptPad is encrypted before being sent, which means nobody can access your data unless you give them the keys (not even us).  Encryption is happening in the browser that is used to access the "Pads" and therefore the central storage facility used does not see unencrypted data and only sees encrypted data passing by.

The ThreeFold team uses it for internal documents and collaboration, and now so can end-users on the ThreeFold Grid. The fucntionality includes:

## A rich text editor

This is an alternative to Word and Google Docs.  Is allows to create documents and collaborate with others to create documents.  Cryptpad supports multi user access to documents for co-editing and collaborations.  The sharing facility uses unique access keys allowing other to see the content unencrypted
