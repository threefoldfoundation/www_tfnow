# Video Chat

![](./img/connect.png)

## Quick Background

Online services that provided end user friendly video conferencing facilities where in high demand and many of the providers of such services have seen a tremendous increase in usage statistics.  Using centralised services for video conferencing create silos of users that can communicate because they use the same tool, and it allows the man in the middle, the video conferencing platform to collect and market data captured by enduser usage.

## How other solutions work ?

When zoom became a very popular (free of charge) video conference solution they changed the policy in terms of how you connected through their platform to others uses.  In this case if you had a free account, all free account users where connected through US based Zoom (central) infrastructure leading to very inefficient capacity usage and a very potential oversight by US agencies and authorities. 

## Here is an example

This examples is for 2 user of the zoom service with a free account based in Salzburg and Vienna.

## How our solution works and what makes it different ?

In an ideal world two two users would connect direct.  No need to make this connection go through any infrastructrure that is not inline to make the connection and this can be done by creating a so called peer to peer video conferencing solution.

Such a peer-to-peer video conferencing solution has been created and exists on the TF Grid.  It has been designed and built by the ThreeFold Tech team and will have a one click deployment option.  

The solution is called **DigitalWE room**.

<!-- ### Deploy

_The solution needs to appear in the threefold now one click solutions board.  Needs to be linked and an explanation (high level depending on how good the local explanation in the deployment process is needs to be provided here_

_create widget which does following,
