## Do you know about Mozilla Hubs ?

Mozilla Hubs is a virtual collaboration platform that runs in your browser. With Hubs you can create your own 3D spaces with a single click. Invite others to join using a URL. No installation or app store required. Hubs is for anyone who wants to connect with others remotely! It's a great way to bring communities together in a shared virtual space.

## Few use cases for Hubs

Host a conference, teach a class, showcase art, or just hang out with friends. Hubs makes it easy to connect and share images, videos, 3D models, and more. With Hubs' spatialized audio you can have conversations with everyone together or break out into smaller groups â€” just like you can in person.

Hubs works across platforms. Got a VR headset? Awesome! If not, you can use your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile devices to explore in 2D (see supported browsers).

Hubs is open source and customizable. Upload personalized avatars or create unique environments using Spoke.

## Hubs on the ThreeFold grid

Hubs cloud is available on hosters that present a centralized cloud platform solution but you can also invest the effort to understand how to deploy a private instance of the software and experience it that way.  The TF Grid offers a solution where you can rent capacity anywhere on the TF Grid (please find the [explorer](https://explorer.grid.tf/) here) and deploy the hubs software similar to what the experiecen on a cloud would be or take it one step further and create your own TF Grid capacity, earn digital currency by doing so and have your own hosted infrastructure for your digital hubs where you feel comfortable of having it.

More details coming soon!
