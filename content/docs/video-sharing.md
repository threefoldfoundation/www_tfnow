# Video Sharing

![](./peertive_window.png)

##  What is a video sharing platform?

In the 2010s, with the increasing prevalence of technology and the Internet in everyday life, video hosting services serve as a portal to different forms of entertainment (comedy, games shows, games, or music), news, documentaries and educational videos. Content may be either be user-generated, amateur clips or commercial products. The entertainment industry uses this medium to release music, videos, movies and television shows directly to the public. Video hosting services are becoming increasingly more popular, especially with the explosion in popularity of blogs, internet forums and other interactive pages. The mass market for camera phones and smartphones has increased the supply of user-generated videos. 

##  Why is video sharing getting popular ?

Traditional methods of personal video distribution, such as making a DVD to show to friends at home, are unsuited to the high volume of camera phone clips. In contrast, current broadband Internet connections are well suited to serving video shot on mobile phones. Most people do not operate web servers as this requires basic knowledge how to do this and therefore created demand for video content hosting.

The popularity of such video sharing platforms have spawned massive organizations presenting platforms on which people and businesses can share their videos. Most of these platforms have build a business model around tracking video consumptions interests and statistics and using this data for marketing purposes or selling it to organisztions for (big) data analysis.  They can do so because the platform forms the central hub (in a hub and spoke model) where video producers reach video consumers by using this platform to connect.


##  What makes our solution different ?

ThreeFold advocates that video sharing can also exist without this central platform (and organisation) in the middle.  You as a producer or consumer can create your own personal, or for social, sport and leisure activities, facility to share videos.  There is open source software available to do so. ThreeFold endorses the [peertube's] decentralized implementation of a video sharing platform.  The open source project has a [roadmap](https://joinpeertube.org/roadmap) that is ambitious and needs support.  Please help us to help peertube.

## Decentralized video sharingn platform

PeerTube is a free and open source video platform that was officially launched on October 11, 2018, and is intended to offer an alternative to platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion. Similar to the open source Twitter alternative Mastodon, PeerTube is decentralized, meaning that it is not hosted by a single person, company, or server. Because it is open source, anyone can make their own “Instance” of PeerTube, which has its own appearance, account management, moderation policy and so on.

Instances can also come together to form Federations, essentially several instances that agree on the same broadcast conditions and share  videos between them. Each video is stored by the Instance that published it but can be viewed by other Instances in the Federation. In turn, Federations are distinct and independent from one another.

## Deploy your own youtube, super powerfull & decentralized.

Unique characteristics of the platform

- PeerTube aspires to be a decentralized and free/libre alternative to video broadcasting services. The TF Grid present a fantastice fabric of compute and storage capabilities for this distributed and federated platform.
- It is a network of inter-connected small videos hosters.
- An open-source, free/libre license code 
- Deploying peertube on the TF Grid is a one clock solution and will get you a private instance to host your videos on.
- The TF Grid is a federation of people and companies that believe the internet should be put back in the hands of people, not large monopolies dominating the internet. Direct contact with a human-scale hoster (which ThreeFold calls farmers) allows for two things: you no longer are the client of a huge tech company, and you can nurture a special relationship with your hoster (Farmer), who distributes your data.
- The PeerTube software can, whenever necessary, use a peer-to-peer protocol (P2P) to broadcast viral videos, lowering the load of their hosts.
> Help Peertube, they are [fundraising](https://joinpeertube.org/roadmap), with little they can make this software even much better.
